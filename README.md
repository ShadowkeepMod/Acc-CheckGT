# Acc-CheckGT
Account CheckGT - A program that greatly facilitates the work of a guarantor in the field of Jenshin impact trades

At the moment, the program performs all basic checks according to the rules of one of the largest networks of SGB trading groups, and is also capable of performing several additional ones.

Basic functional:
* Checking for legendary characters
* Checking weapons available
* Checking the donation on the account
* Checking weapons from the battle pass in the archive
* Checking for third-party bindings to the game account

Also, in addition to basic checks, there are additional ones that can be turned on and off depending on the need for a particular transaction. The list of such functions is gradually expanding. To increase the speed and quality of the transaction, in the second tab you can set the mail you need (the mail to which the account of the first party on the transaction is temporarily relinked) for quick copying, and for each transaction you can generate new random passwords and also quickly copy them.
With 1 button, you can check your entire account much faster than manually, for example, it takes me an average of 30 seconds to complete basic checks (this value may vary depending on the power of your computer)

For the program to work, before starting the check, make sure that the game is running at a resolution of 1280x720 and the browser must be maximized to full screen. It is also highly recommended to run the program as an administrator. If for some reason the program does not work on your device, then you can write to me in telegram @Sansenskiy and maybe I will answer you.
